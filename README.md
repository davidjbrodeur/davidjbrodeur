Hi, I'm David Brodeur. I'm a software developper. 

I'm interested in Web Dev (React), Software applications and embedded softwares. 

I'm currently learning about test-driven developpement and React (Javascript) web apps. I have knowledge in most common programming language (Python, C, C++, C#, Java) and web-dev (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript).

I'm willing to collaborate on projects pertaining to those and I'm looking for employment at the moment.
